# Naive-Bayes-using-python
Bayes’ Theorem provides a way that we can calculate the probability of a piece of data belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge. Bayes’ Theorem is stated as:

P(class|data) = (P(data|class) * P(class)) / P(data)
Where P(class|data) is the probability of class given the provided data.
